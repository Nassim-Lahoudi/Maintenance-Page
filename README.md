# Maintenance Page

A small React-based maintenance page built with Vite.

This repository contains a minimal web app intended to be used as a placeholder page during maintenance windows.

## Contents

- `index.html` – App entry point
- `src/` – Source code (React components, styles, assets)
- `public/` – Static files served as-is
- `package.json` – Project metadata and scripts

## Requirements

- Node.js (LTS recommended) and npm, or pnpm/yarn
- Git (for cloning)

Recommended: Node.js 18.x or newer.

## Local development

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Start the development server (hot-reload):

```bash
npm run dev
```

The dev server typically runs at `http://localhost:5173` (Vite default). Open that URL in your browser.

## Build for production

Create an optimized production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

The build output will be written to the `dist/` directory.

To preview the built app locally:

```bash
npm run preview
```

## Linting

This project includes an ESLint configuration. Run the linter with:

```bash
npm run lint
```

## Project structure (short)

- `src/main.jsx` – App entry (React mounting)
- `src/App.jsx` – Main component
- `src/index.css`, `src/App.css` – Styles
- `src/assets/` – Images and static assets

Customize the components and styles to adapt the page to your needs.

## Deployment notes

Files in `dist/` can be deployed to any static hosting provider (Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages, AWS S3, Firebase Hosting, etc.). If your app uses client-side routing, make sure your host is configured to serve the SPA entry for unknown paths.

Quick example for GitHub Pages:

1. Build: `npm run build`
2. Publish the contents of `dist/` to the `gh-pages` branch or upload them via the repository settings.
